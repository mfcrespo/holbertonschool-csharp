# 0x08. C# - Inheritance

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* What is inheritance
* How is polymorphism achieved with inheritance
* What is a base class
* What is a derived class
* How to create a derived class
* How to override a method or property inherited from the base class
* What is the difference between the override and new modifiers
* What are is, .GetType(), TypeOf(), .IsInstanceOfType(), and .IsSubclassOf() and when to use them

## Requirements

### General
* Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
* Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your Github and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
* You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
* In the following examples, the main.cs files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wonâ€™t take them into account). We will use our own main.cs files at compilation. Our main.cs files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* All your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
* All your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags
