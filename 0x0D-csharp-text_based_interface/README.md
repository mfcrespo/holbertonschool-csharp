### Tasks

| **Filename** | **Files** | **Description** |
|---|---|---|
| 0. Base knowledge | (InventoryManagement.sln, InventoryLibrary/, InventoryLibrary/BaseClass.cs) | Create a new solution called InventoryManagement. In the solution, add a new .NET class library project called InventoryLibrary  |
| 1. Taking inventory | (InventoryLibrary/Item.cs, InventoryLibrary/User.cs, InventoryLibrary/Inventory.cs) | Within the InventoryLibrary, create a class called Item that inherits from BaseClass  |
| 2. In Store | (InventoryLibrary/JSONStorage.cs, storage/, storage/inventory_manager.json) | With our classes defined, letâ€™s create our storage class. Create a class called JSONStorage  |
| 3. Inventory Manager Simulator | (InventoryManager/, InventoryManager/InventoryManager.cs) | Time to create the console application! Add a new console application called InventoryManager to the solution and add a reference to the InventoryLibrary  |
