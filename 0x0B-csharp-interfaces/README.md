# 0x0B. C# - Interfaces

## Requirements

### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task.
* Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your GitHub and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
* You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
* In the following examples, the main.cs files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wonâ€™t take them into account). We will use our own main.cs files at compilation. Our main.cs files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* All your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
* All your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags

### Tasks

| **Filename** | **Files** | **Description** |
|---|---|---|
| 0. Abstract thinking | (0-abstract_thinking/) | Create an abstract class called Base  |
| 1. User interface | (1-user_interface/) | Based on 0-abstract_thinking, create an interface called IInteractive  |
| 2. Escape room | (2-doors/) | Based on 1-user_interface, delete the TestObject class. Create a new class called Door that inherits from Base and IInteractive  |
| 3. Interior decorating | (3-decorations/) | Based on 2-doors, create a new class called Decoration that inherits from Base, IInteractive, and IBreakable  |
| 4. Key collecting | (4-keys/) | Based on 3-decorations, create a new class called Key that inherits from Base and ICollectable  |
| 5. Iterate and act | (5-iterate_act/) | Based on 4-keys, create a new class called RoomObjects and a method called IterateAction. This method should take a list of all objects, iterate through it, and execute methods depending on what interface that item implements. (ex: if the item uses IInteractive, your IterateAction method should call Interact() on it)  |
| 6. Better iterating and acting | (6-generic_iteration/) | Based on 5-iterate_act, remove the RoomObjects class created in the previous task. Create a new generic class Objs<T> that creates a collection of type T objects that can be iterated through using foreach  |
