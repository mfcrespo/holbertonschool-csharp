# 0x05. C# - Structs, Enumerations

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* What is a struct
* What is a constructor
* What is a field
* What is a property
* What is an enumeration and when to use them
* What does toString do and how to override it

## Requirements

### General
* Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
* Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your Github and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
* You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
* In the following examples, the main.cs files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wonâ€™t take them into account). We will use our own main.cs files at compilation. Our main.cs files might be different from the one shown in the examples

### Tasks

| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| 0. They're good dogs | Define a new enum Rating with the values Good, Great, Excellent.  |
| 1. Chief Puppy Officer | Based on 0-dog, define a new struct Dog  |
| 2. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself | Based on 1-dog, add a constructor to struct Dog that takes parameters.  |
| 3. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad | Based on 2-dog, override the .ToString() method to print the Dog objectâ€™s attributes to stdout.  |
