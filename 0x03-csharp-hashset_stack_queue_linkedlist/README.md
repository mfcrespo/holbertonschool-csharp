# 0x03. C# - Data Structures: HashSet, Stack, Queue, LinkedList

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
* How to create and use arrays
* What are Collections in C#
* How to create and use hashsets
* How to create and use stacks
* How to create and use queues
* How to create and use linked lists
* How to use foreach

## Requirements

### C# Tasks
* Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code.
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet.
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
* All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
* You do not need to know about namespaces and classes yet. Namespaces should be omitted in this project.
* Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your Github and ensure the task names on the folders are correct.
* You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders.
* In the following examples, the main.cs files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wonâ€™t take them into account). We will use our own main.cs files at compilation. Our main.cs files might be different from the one shown in the examples.

### Tasks

| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| [0. Unique addition](./0-unique_add/) | method that adds all unique integers in a list.  |
| [1. Present in both](./1-common_elements/) | method that returns a sorted list of common elements in two lists.  |
| [2. Only differents](./2-different_elements/) | method that returns a sorted list of all elements present in one or the other list but not both.  |
| [3. Full stack](./3-stack_push_pop/) | Given a Stack<string>, write a program that does the following:  |
| [4. Queue it up](./4-queue_enqueue_dequeue) | Given a Queue<string>, write a program that does the following:  |
| [5. Print a LinkedList](./5-print_linkedlist/) | method that creates and prints a LinkedList of integers of a given size.  |
| [6. LinkedList length](./6-linkedlist_length/) | method that returns the number of elements in a LinkedList.  |
| [7. Add node to the beginning](./7-linkedlist_add/) |  method that adds a node to the beginning of a LinkedList. |
| [8. Find value](./8-linkedlist_find/) | method that finds a value in a LinkedList and returns its index position in the list.  |
| [9. Pop](./9-linkedlist_pop/) | method that deletes the head node of a LinkedList and returns that nodeâ€™s data.  |
| [10. Get node at index](./10-linkedlist_get_node/) | method that returns the value of the nth node of a LinkedList.  |
| [11. LinkedList sum](./11-linkedlist_sum/) | method that returns the sum of all the data of a LinkedList.  |
| [12. Insert in order](./12-linkedlist_insert/) | method that inserts a new node in the correct position in an ordered LinkedList.  |
| [13. Delete at index](./13-linkedlist_delete/) | method that deletes the node at given position in a LinkedList.
