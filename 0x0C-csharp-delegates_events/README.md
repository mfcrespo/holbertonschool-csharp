# 0x0C. C# - Delegates, Events

## Requirements

### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* You can organize and name your files as you like for this project, just ensure you do not push a file containing a Main method, it may conflict with our testing files.
* Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your GitHub and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
* You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
* In the following examples, the main.cs files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wonâ€™t take them into account). We will use our own main.cs files at compilation. Our main.cs files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* All your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
* All your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags
